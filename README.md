## 🧾 Project Description

This project applies machine learning to identify distinct customer groups using behavior and demographic data. It is designed to support:

- Personalized marketing strategies  
- Data-driven customer segmentation  
- Cluster-based analytics for strategic decision-making

The pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature scaling and engineering  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative)  
- Visual analytics and deployment via Streamlit

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**  
- **K-Means Clustering with Elbow & Silhouette Score**  
- **DBSCAN & Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**  
- **Visual Analytics & Interpretation**
